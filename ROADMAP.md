# Roadmap

This repository hosts the **Barcode** suite for Odoo: a set of modules built
around a fast, full-screen barcode scanning experience. The base belongs to no
domain in particular; each feature module brings one.

The suite is designed to be **modular**: `barcode_scanner` is the base
framework — the scanning engine every other module plugs into — and each
feature module is an optional add-on for a specific area (warehouse, inventory,
camera input, GS1 nomenclature, purchase, quality, …). Modules register their
screens, scan handlers and menu tiles into the base instead of patching it, so
you install only what you need.

Where two modules have to meet — a barcode format and a warehouse operation,
say — the glue is its own small **bridge** module, so neither side has to know
about the other and you can install either alone.

> This roadmap reflects our current intentions. Priorities and scope may change.
> Feedback and contributions are welcome — open an issue to discuss a module or
> suggest a new one.

## Details

### barcode_scanner — *base framework*

The scanning engine every other module builds on: the full-screen client
action shell, the registries that let modules plug in screens, scan handlers
and menu tiles, the barcode input service, real-time feedback (audio/vibration),
the ORM/API wrapper, and the shared hooks. It carries no business logic of its
own — install a feature module on top to get actual operations.

### barcode_stock — *warehouse operations*

The warehouse application: receipts (incoming), deliveries (outgoing), internal
transfers, and quick product/location lookups, with real-time validation on
each scan. This is what most users think of as "the barcode app"; it registers
its screens and handlers into `barcode_scanner`.

### barcode_camera

Use a device's built-in camera as a barcode reader, so operators can scan
without dedicated hardware. Complements the app for phones, tablets, and
laptops.

### barcode_gs1

GS1 barcode support (GS1-128 and application identifiers) on top of the base
scanner, which on its own reads EAN13. It registers a parser instead of
patching the base, so a single scan yields the product plus its structured
data: lot/serial, production and expiry dates, counts, net weight and SSCC.
The warehouse app then applies the scanned quantity and lot without knowing
anything about GS1.

### barcode_gs1_stock — *bridge*

Makes the measure a GS1 label carries — a net weight, typically — the quantity
picked, in the unit the product is stocked in. It is the piece of the puzzle
neither side can hold on its own: the parser does not know how a product is
stocked, and the warehouse app does not know GS1. Installs itself once both are
installed.

### barcode_stock_product_multi_barcode

Lets the warehouse app resolve a scan against every barcode a product carries,
not just its main one, by bridging `product_multi_barcode` into the scanning
flow. Warehouses that receive the same article under a supplier code and an
internal one stop having to relabel it.

### barcode_stock_unexpected_product

Puts a product the transfer never listed onto it, straight from the scan, for
the operation types where a warehouse allows it. What arrives is not always
what was planned; this records the difference instead of forcing a detour
through the back office.

### barcode_inventory

Run inventory adjustments and stock counts from the scanner: pick or scan an
internal location, count its products by scanning — reading the lot/serial and
quantity from a GS1 label when present, and letting a lot/serial product hold
several lines, one per number — then apply. Each count is recorded as a
`stock_inventory` adjustment group (draft → in progress → done), so it leaves a
traceable, auditable record with its own move lines, using Odoo's native
on-hand adjustment.

### barcode_scrap

Scrap goods without leaving the scanner: scan the product and the location it is
being written off from, state the quantity and the reason, and the scrap order is
created and validated on the spot.

### barcode_purchase

Drive purchase order receiving from the scanner: match incoming goods against
purchase orders and confirm receptions by barcode.

### barcode_quality

Integrate Odoo quality checks into the scanning flow, so quality control steps
can be triggered and completed while processing operations.
